My solution:

select ad_id, round(ifnull(clickcount / sum(clickcount + viewcount)*100,0),2) as ctr
from 
(select ad_id, sum(case when action='Clicked' then 1 else 0 end) as clickcount , sum(case when action='Viewed' then 1 else 0 end) as viewcount
from Ads
group by ad_id) as t
group by ad_id
order by ctr desc, ad_id;

Error: did not add ad_id in the order by column. Did not pass all the test cases, for example if you have 2 different ad_ids with 
the same calculated ctr value it should display the smallest ad_id value first.

Other solutions:

select ad_id, 
ifnull(round(avg(Case when action="Clicked" Then 1
                      when action ="Viewed" Then 0 else NULL end)*100,2),0) as ctr 
from Ads
group by ad_id 
order by ctr DESC, ad_id

explanation of why avg was used: https://leetcode.com/problems/ads-performance/discuss/485165/MYSQL-Easy-solution

SELECT ad_id,
COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(action = "Clicked") / (SUM(action = "Clicked") + SUM(action = "Viewed")) * 100, 2), 0) AS ctr 
FROM Ads
GROUP BY ad_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id ASC
