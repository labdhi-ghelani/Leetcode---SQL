My solution:


select 
Request_at as Day,
round(sum(case when Status='completed' then 0 else 1 end) / count(distinct Id),2) as 'Cancellation Rate'
from Trips
where (Client_id) not in (select Users_Id
from Users 
where  Banned = 'Yes')  and (Driver_id) not in (select Users_Id
from Users 
where  Banned = 'Yes') and Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
group by  Request_at
;

Other Solution:

select
    Request_at as Day,
    round(SUM(CASE WHEN Status like 'cancelled%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
          /count(Status),2) as 'Cancellation Rate'
from
    Trips
where
    Request_at between '2013-10-01' and '2013-10-03'
    and
    Client_id not in (select Users_Id from Users where Banned = 'Yes')
group by
    Request_at
    
    
 #Using JOINS (* Imp: Joined Trips with 2 Users table each with specific conditions)
 
SELECT s.Day, ROUND(AVG(s.cancel_count),2) AS "Cancellation Rate"
FROM
(SELECT t.Id, CASE WHEN t.Status <> 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS cancel_count, t.Request_at AS Day
FROM Trips t
JOIN Users u1
ON t.Client_Id = u1.Users_Id
JOIN Users u2
ON t.Driver_Id = u2. Users_Id
WHERE u1.Banned = 'No' AND u2.Banned = 'No' AND t.Request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03') s
GROUP BY s.Day
ORDER BY s.Day
