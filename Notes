Error: Unkown coolumn in having clause
The SQL standard requires that HAVING must reference only columns in the GROUP BY clause or columns used in aggregate functions. 
However, MySQL supports an extension to this behavior, and permits HAVING to refer to columns in the SELECT list and columns in outer subqueries as well

Can i use max and count together in SQL?
You canâ€™t. It is not possible to nest aggregate functions like max(count(...))
It is not allowed to use two aggregate functions in the SELECT statement. 
The solution is to create a table to get the results from the inner function first, 
and then use this table for calling the second function on the respective column.

Can i use max() without groupby()?
In the absence of a GROUP BY clause aggregation occurs over all rows returned by the query.
